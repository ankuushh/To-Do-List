# To-Do-List
In this project,  I implemented features such as task prioritization, due dates, and reminders using JavaScript. I also incorporated local storage functionality to save users' tasks, providing a seamless experience across sessions. The emphasis was on simplicity and usability, allowing users to manage their tasks effectively without unnecessary complexity.
